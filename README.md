# 🧠 Brain Tumor Classification using MRI Images

This project focuses on classifying brain tumor MRI images into different categories using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Brain tumors can be life-threatening if not diagnosed early.  
This project uses MRI scan images to classify tumors into the following categories:

- Glioma
- Meningioma
- Pituitary Tumor
- No Tumor

The goal is to assist in early detection using image-based classification.
